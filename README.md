The Project focusses on the CICD tools where The developer would initiate to push the code through to **Github **where by **Jenkins** would pull the source codes made by the developers. Jenkins would use **Maven** to compile the code and integrate the code into an artifact whereby the artifact will be into a **.JAR or .WAR** version of the file. The artifact is turned into a **Dockerfile** so it may be built into an image which is further pushed into** Dockerhub** to be pulled into a compiled and ready format.The **Kubernetes cludter** is thus created where we focus on creation of the **Master and the Worker Node** and focus is done towards an** EKS cluster** which is handled by **Pipeline** methods of **Jenkins**.
